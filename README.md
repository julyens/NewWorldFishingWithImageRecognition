New World Fishing With Image Recognition

Hello

I tough it would be funny to try to fish in New World by trying to use image recognition.

This project searchs for on image inside another image.

In this case, some key elements of the fishing UI, inside a printscreen each 900ms.

When it finds one of the key elements it will do a mouse click or extended mouse click.

:D
